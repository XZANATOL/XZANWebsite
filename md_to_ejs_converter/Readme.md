## MD_To_EJS_Convertor

Automated workflow that converts written blogs in Obsidian into custom defined ejs templates.

After writing a new blog (using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)), I usually spend around 1~2 hours re-editing the file into a new ejs file to satisfy my blog view style. So I built this Python workflow to automate the task.

	* [x] Add support to convert images into base64.
